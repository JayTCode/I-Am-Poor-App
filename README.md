# I-Am-Poor-App
This project was created as a way to learn iOS Development from Angela Yu's iOS Development Course on Udemy. 
It uses XCode to create the frame work and functionality of the app, while using image assets (provided by Angela Yu App Brewery Website), and Canva to create additional icon images.
